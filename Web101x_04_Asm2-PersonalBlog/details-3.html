        I consider a really good pound cake to be an essential for everyone's
        recipe box or binder; if flavored the right way, it can stand on its
        own, but can also be dressed up with toppings or cut up to layer in a
        trifle. Whether you're looking for a weeknight dessert or something
        everyone will love for a holiday or birthday party, this cream cheese
        pound cake will never let you down!

        It's incredibly simple to make and while a standard pound cake does not
        contain cream cheese, it really adds such a tremendous amount of
        moisture, tenderness, and flavor, making it, in my opinion, the best
        ever. This is by far my absolute favorite pound cake recipe!

      <h2>What exactly is a pound cake</h2>
      <p>
        The first traces of pound cake recipes are in northern Europe in the
        1700s and it has grown across the globe since. A cake that required
        equal parts of flour, butter, sugar, and eggs was easy to remember in a
        time where many could not read a traditional cookbook. It required
        nothing more than a spoon and some elbow grease in the kitchen. Hundreds
        of years later, nearly every region is making its own version of this
        moist, dense cake.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some French-speaking countries, rum is added as a Christmas Eve
        tradition. In both Mexico and Germany, dried fruit and liquor are added.
        I have some other variation ideas below, and theyâ€™re all phenomenal!
        Cream cheese pound cake is an American twist on the classic, and it is
        downright delicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many modern recipes, including this one, adjust the original one
        pound-only proportions to accommodate some other ingredients (like cream
        cheese!).

      <h2>Ingredients for cream cheese pound cake</h2>
      <p>
        It's super important for the texture of the cake that the butter, cream
        cheese, and eggs be at room temperature before you start mixing the cake
        better. This ensures that everything can emulsify and incorporate
        thoroughly, which gives us that moist, dense, and delicious cake!
