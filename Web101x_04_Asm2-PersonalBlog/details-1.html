      <h2>Yellow cake with chocolate frosting</h2>
      <p>
        This fluffy vanilla cake recipe is the absolute best yellow cake from
        scratch and paired with the silky smooth chocolate frosting, you can't
        beat it for a classic birthday cake or any other celebration!
      </p>

      <p>
        Are you a box mix yellow cake person? Or a from-scratch yellow cake
        parson?
      </p>
      <p>
        Truth be told, it's REALLY hard to replicate that
        always-moist-and-fluffy texture that everyone loves about a box cake
        mix, but at the same time, we also love homemade, right?!
      </p>
      <p>
        It took me a LONG time to find a homemade yellow cake that I really,
        really loved. Box cake mixes seem to always bake up perfectly fluffy and
        moist yellow cakes, and the ones I've had from bakeries have been great
        as well, but I just couldn't seem to replicate it at home no matter how
        many recipes I tried. (Consequently, I haven't had the same issue with
        chocolate cakes! See: Snickers Cake - the base recipe for all of my
        chocolate cakes!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Many were too dense, too dry, too chiffon-like, too fussy in their
        preparation. I just wanted a fantastic yellow cake recipe I could use
        for birthday cakes that was easy to make and turned out delicious. I
        came across this recipe from Joy while I was on the hunt for yet another
        recipe to test out for Joseph's birthday.
      </p>
      <p>This was IT. The recipe that had eluded me for years!</p>

      <p>
        I love that this can easily be mixed together in one bowl using my hand
        mixer; there's nothing fussy about the ingredients or preparation, and
        it procedures an absolutely perfect yellow cake. The layers are light
        but sturdy, buttery and moist, and the ideal base for your very favorite
        chocolate frosting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used the chocolate frosting recipe from my ultimate chocolate
        cupcakes, and it was a wonderful companion to this cake. The frosting is
        more buttery than sugary, satinysmooth and full of rich chocolate
        flavor. It glides on like a dream!
      </p>

      <p>
        Yellow cake tends to be the elusive unicorn of homemade baking; so many
        cakes can turn out too dry, to0 crumbly, too dense, too cornbread-like,
        and I have one major piece of advace for ensuring yellow cake
        perfection:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Make sure all of the ingredients listed "at room temperature" ARE
          ACTUALLY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I've totally been there and have used still-cool butter, eggs or dairy
        in a recipe when I'm in a hurry, but it's actually vitally important
        here. Having all of those ingredients at room temperature ensures that
        they emulsify, which traps air in the batter and, once in the oven, that
        air expands and produces a fluffy cake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Room temperature ingredients also ensure that the batter comes together
        well and is ultra-smooth, which keeps the resulting cake from being
        crumbly or combread-like.
