      <h2>Coconut Bundt Cake with White Chocolate-Coconut Glaze</h2>
      <p>
        Last week flew by and before I knew it, it was time to plan the menu for
        Sunday dinner. Sundays have been a perfect opportunity for me to
        experiment with new dessert recipes, especially those that serve tons of
        people, since we have help polishing it all off and don’t have it
        sitting around the house, tempting us for days.
      </p>

        I love anything with coconut during the spring and summertime, and Bundt
        cakes are not only easy but they’re pretty and are perfect for serving a
        crowd. When I started flipping through a couple of my newer cookbooks
        and saw a recipe for a coconut Bundt cake, dessert was immediately
        decided.

      <p>
        This cake comes pretty darn close to a coconut pound cake, as there is
        quite a bit of butter, sugar and eggs that help to create a wonderfully
        rich and moist cake. The coconut flavor is derived from a large amount
        of coconut milk in both the cake and glaze, as well as a healthy dose of
        coconut extract. I also added toasted shredded coconut on top of the
        glaze because, well, I feel like any type of coconut dessert needs to be
        topped with toasted coconut.
      </p>

        A couple of years ago, a coconut cake would have never ranked high on my
        list of cake options, but between the coconut cupcakes I made last year
        and this cake, I am a total coconut convert.

        Plus, after everyone went home yesterday, we were only left with two
        small pieces of cake. Win-win!
