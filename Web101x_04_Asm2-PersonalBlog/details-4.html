      <h1>German Chocolate Cake</h1>
      <p>
        I have long associated German Chocolate Cake with Father's Day, although
        I'm not entirely sure why. I think I remember my mom making it for my
        dad once or twice growing up (although never on Father's Day,
        ironically) and the correlation must have stuck somewhere along the way.

        Although I don't have a distinct memory to tie the two together, German
        Chocolate Cake just seems like a “man's man” cake, doesn't it? So many
        chocolate layers with a sugary pecan-coconut filling in between and then
        iced in more chocolate… it's certainly not a cake for the faint of
        heart! With Father's Day coming up this Sunday, I'm sure this cake could
        make many men in your life happy!

        Up until recently, I thought that this cake actually originated in
        Germany, hence the name. Turns out, it’s as American as the Big Mac. Who
        knew?! Way back in 1852, Sam German developed a brand of dark chocolate
        for Baker’s Chocolate Company and the resulting product, Baker’s
        German’s Sweet Chocolate, was named in honor of him. Then, in the late
        1950’s, the original recipe for “German’s Chocolate Cake”, which used
        the baking chocolate, was submitted by a homemaker to a local newspaper.
        It became insanely popular, so much so, that the company that owned
        Baker’s Chocolate noticed and distributed the recipe to other newspapers
        across the country. Reportedly, sales of the chocolate increased 73% ,
        and the cake became famous. Here’s hoping that homemaker from Dallas who
        came up with the recipe got a little piece of the action!

        This recipe was actually my second go at German Chocolate Cake recently,
        and I’m pretty confident it will be my last. I first turned to my usual
        trusted source for classic recipes when I set about making the cake, but
        ended up being surprisingly disappointed. The cake layers were wispy
        thin and the chocolate flavor was severely lacking. I started my search
        over and when I came across this recipe I thought it looked extremely
        promising. It was described as a “big, tall” cake with four layers
        brushed with a rum syrup, lots of filling and iced with a fantastic
        chocolate ganache. This cake delivered and then some.
      </p>

        You can’t taste the rum in the syrup, but it accents the chocolate
        flavor and keeps the cake nice and moist. The filling is studded with
        toasted pecans and toasted coconut; the toasting takes mere minutes but
        adds so much in terms of flavor and texture. Finally, the icing isn’t
        overpowering, but a perfect complement and finishing touch to the cake –
        you don’t want to skip it!
